- What is SSMS? 
  SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is an integrated environment for managing any SQL infrastructure. Use SSMS to access, 
  configure, manage, administer, and develop all components of SQL Server, Azure SQL Database , Azure SQL Managed Instance, 
  SQL Server on Azure VM, and Azure Synapse Analytics. SSMS provides a single comprehensive utility that combines a broad 
  group of graphical tools with many rich script editors to provide access to SQL Server for developers and database administrators 
  of all skill levels.
